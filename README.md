# extracurricular-learning
Master overview of all my extracurricular learning endeavours, be they finished or in progress.

**Note:** The base of this guide is my personalized fork of the awesome Computer Science and Programming Guide by P1xt, so many thanks and credit goes to P1xt. Please check out the full original guide over at [P1xt/p1xt-guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides). 
Most of the programming guide is the same as the original, but I added some of my own ressources here and there to supplement some of the learning. This repo is only to keep track of my learning, all links will be to seperate repos where I keep notes, questions/answers and code.
